We have taken existing dataset from below provided link to generate STREAMLIT APP.
The application displays Bayesian Deep Learning classifications for galaxies. The script defines a main function that creates a title and a sub-header for the web app. It also provides a brief description of the model used and its predictions.
The tell_me_more() function provides an explanation of how the model was built and trained, including information about the loss function and the types of distributions used.
The script imports several Python libraries that are used to build the web app, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and tensorflow. The PIL library is also imported to work with images.
There are commented-out lines of code that seem to be part of a future development.
